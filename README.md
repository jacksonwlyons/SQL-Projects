# SQL-Project 1

In this project I found data from Grand Slam tennis tournaments and did some simple queries to make insights about the 
winners and their success in finals. The data set that I found only had data up to 2018, so I had to do some research and 
update the data set to current (October 17, 2021). I then used Tableau to help visualize my insights.
